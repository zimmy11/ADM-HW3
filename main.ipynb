His focus is on local, seasonal ingredients, including produce from his two kitchen gardens and fish sourced from local fishermen as well as from his own ventures out to sea.   \n",

Situated on the 9th floor of the Romeo hotel overlooking the port, the restaurant boasts fine views of Vesuvius and the Bay of Naples, especially at sunset when the colours are truly spectacular. Meanwhile, the modern dining room, decorated completely in black, is equally as stunning as its surroundings. Alessandro Lucassino, who was born in 1991 and has years of experience working with his mentor, adds a personal flavour to local recipes: by using short cooking times, he preserves the nutritious qualities and flavours of local fish and vegetables while remaining faithful to Ducasse’s “cuisine de la naturalité” philosophy.   \n",
      "4  This historic building in the town centre has been brought back to life by the family of local entrepreneurs who bought it years ago and who have given the restaurant their name. Now an exclusive food venue just a stone’s throw from the capital of the “Food Valley” region, Palazzo Utini is home to a bar and bistro on its ground floor, while the first floor is occupied by the gourmet restaurant overseen by chef Enrico Bartolini and run by resident chef Roberto Monopoli who has plenty of culinary experience behind him. Guests can choose individual dishes from the tasting menus à la carte style, plus there’s an extensive wine list. We particularly enjoyed the exquisite turbot saltimbocca and the onion, black cherry and Lambrusco dessert. On the upper floors, elegant and intimate guestrooms are decorated in the same reassuring style as the rest of the building.   \n",

Meanwhile, the modern dining room, decorated completely in black, is equally as stunning as its surroundings. Alessandro Lucassino, who was born in 1991 and has years of experience working with his mentor, adds a personal flavour to local recipes: by using short cooking times, he preserves the nutritious qualities and flavours of local fish and vegetables while remaining faithful to Ducasse’s “cuisine de la naturalité” philosophy.   \n",

His focus is on local, seasonal ingredients, including produce from his two kitchen gardens and fish sourced from local fishermen as well as from his own ventures out to sea.   \n",

Situated on the 9th floor of the Romeo hotel overlooking the port, the restaurant boasts fine views of Vesuvius and the Bay of Naples, especially at sunset when the colours are truly spectacular. Meanwhile, the modern dining room, decorated completely in black, is equally as stunning as its surroundings. Alessandro Lucassino, who was born in 1991 and has years of experience working with his mentor, adds a personal flavour to local recipes: by using short cooking times, he preserves the nutritious qualities and flavours of local fish and vegetables while remaining faithful to Ducasse’s “cuisine de la naturalité” philosophy.   \n",
      "4  This historic building in the town centre has been brought back to life by the family of local entrepreneurs who bought it years ago and who have given the restaurant their name. Now an exclusive food venue just a stone’s throw from the capital of the “Food Valley” region, Palazzo Utini is home to a bar and bistro on its ground floor, while the first floor is occupied by the gourmet restaurant overseen by chef Enrico Bartolini and run by resident chef Roberto Monopoli who has plenty of culinary experience behind him. Guests can choose individual dishes from the tasting menus à la carte style, plus there’s an extensive wine list. We particularly enjoyed the exquisite turbot saltimbocca and the onion, black cherry and Lambrusco dessert. On the upper floors, elegant and intimate guestrooms are decorated in the same reassuring style as the rest of the building.   \n",

Here, he creates dishes that combine traditional influences and classic favourites from Campania with his own individual flair and creativity. His focus is on local, seasonal ingredients, including produce from his two kitchen gardens and fish sourced from local fishermen as well as from his own ventures out to sea.   \n",

Situated on the 9th floor of the Romeo hotel overlooking the port, the restaurant boasts fine views of Vesuvius and the Bay of Naples, especially at sunset when the colours are truly spectacular. Meanwhile, the modern dining room, decorated completely in black, is equally as stunning as its surroundings. Alessandro Lucassino, who was born in 1991 and has years of experience working with his mentor, adds a personal flavour to local recipes: by using short cooking times, he preserves the nutritious qualities and flavours of local fish and vegetables while remaining faithful to Ducasse’s “cuisine de la naturalité” philosophy.   \n",
      "4  This historic building in the town centre has been brought back to life by the family of local entrepreneurs who bought it years ago and who have given the restaurant their name. Now an exclusive food venue just a stone’s throw from the capital of the “Food Valley” region, Palazzo Utini is home to a bar and bistro on its ground floor, while the first floor is occupied by the gourmet restaurant overseen by chef Enrico Bartolini and run by resident chef Roberto Monopoli who has plenty of culinary experience behind him. Guests can choose individual dishes from the tasting menus à la carte style, plus there’s an extensive wine list. We particularly enjoyed the exquisite turbot saltimbocca and the onion, black cherry and Lambrusco dessert. On the upper floors, elegant and intimate guestrooms are decorated in the same reassuring style as the rest of the building.   \n",

    "In this part of our project, we're creating a unique vocabulary and an inverted index for our restaurant descriptions. This approach helps us quickly look up which documents (or restaurant entries) contain specific terms, making search and retrieval much faster and more efficient. Here's a breakdown of each step:\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Creating Unique Document IDs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   We assign a unique document ID to each entry in our DataFrame by setting document_id equal to each entry's index. This gives each restaurant a distinct identifier, making it easy to refer back to specific entries later in our inverted index.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Initializing Vocabulary and Inverted Index:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "*   We set up an empty dictionary vocab to store unique terms (words) and their IDs. The current_term_id counter keeps track of the IDs as we assign them. We also initialize inverted_index, a dictionary that will map each term to a list of document IDs where that term appears.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "  **Defining the get_term_id Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The get_term_id function is crucial for building our vocabulary. It checks if a word already has an ID in vocab; if not, it assigns the next available ID to the word. This function ensures that each word has a unique ID, which we can use as a key in our inverted index.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "  **Building Vocabulary and Inverted Index:**       \n",
    "*   We then go through each restaurant’s description in the DataFrame. For each description, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1.   Retrieve the document_id and split the cleaned text into individual words.\n",
    "  2.   Use set(words) to get unique words, preventing duplicate entries of the same word in a single document.\n",
    "  3.   For each unique word, we get or assign a term ID using get_term_id, then update our inverted_index to add the document_id to the list of documents associated with this term. This structure allows us to quickly retrieve all documents containing a given word.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "  **Saving Vocabulary to CSV:**\n",
    "*   Once our vocabulary is built, we save it to a CSV file called vocabulary.csv. This file provides a convenient reference for the terms and their IDs, which will be helpful for other tasks or for reloading the vocabulary later.\n",
    "        \n",
    "  **Saving the Inverted Index as JSON:**\n",
    "*   We save the inverted_index as a JSON file. The JSON format preserves the dictionary structure and can be easily loaded later to quickly retrieve documents that contain specific terms.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "  **Loading the Inverted Index and Vocabulary for Searches:**\n",
    "*   Finally, we include commands to reload the inverted index and vocabulary. When we need to process a search query, we load inverted_index.json and vocabulary.csv to retrieve terms and their associated document IDs, making our search functionality efficient and ready to use.\n"

Situated on the 9th floor of the Romeo hotel overlooking the port, the restaurant boasts fine views of Vesuvius and the Bay of Naples, especially at sunset when the colours are truly spectacular. Meanwhile, the modern dining room, decorated completely in black, is equally as stunning as its surroundings. Alessandro Lucassino, who was born in 1991 and has years of experience working with his mentor, adds a personal flavour to local recipes: by using short cooking times, he preserves the nutritious qualities and flavours of local fish and vegetables while remaining faithful to Ducasse’s “cuisine de la naturalité” philosophy.   \n",

His recipes are modern and personalised, with careful attention naturally paid to harmonious presentation, while the flavour of his dishes is brought out by ingredients that are skilfully chosen from the Abruzzo inland area. In 2024, the restaurant moved to new, centrally located premises which have an intimate feel and are elegant and minimalist in style.   \n",

      "36  This long-established restaurant has been part of the Milanese culinary scene for over 60 years and continues to attract food-lovers in search of top-quality cuisine today. It serves a generous tasting menu that showcases Italian cuisine in modern dishes, some inspired by the origins of the two dynamic chefs, Alessandro Negrini and Fabio Pisani (the former from Lombardy, the latter from Puglia). There’s also a menu dedicated to the seasons, where seasonal vegetables enhance the different dishes, while the “Omaggio a Milano” (Tribute to Milan – tortelli pasta stuffed with Fassona beef ossobuco and marrow in a Sardinian saffron and parmesan reduction) is always very popular. Make sure you allow plenty of time to peruse the extensive wine selection which is displayed on a tablet and includes some hard-to-find labels. The service is courteous and attentive throughout.   \n",
      "37                     An idyllic picture-postcard setting in a panoramic location overlooking Santa Croce lake, surrounded by villages and mountain peaks. This is matched by an elegant interior with a mix of antique and modern furnishings, and a succession of stylish small dining rooms and lounges, including an open fireplace where many of the ingredients are cooked. For over a century, this restaurant has told the story of the De Pra family and their love for the mountains which is clearly evident in the cuisine served here. Chef Riccardo has strengthened this connection by intensifying his search for local ingredients (game, mushrooms, freshwater fish etc) and cultivating his own kitchen garden and vineyard. The fragrant ingredients are prepared simply yet with technical expertise, with flavour always the primary focus – an infallible recipe for resounding success!   \n",

Your meal starts in a memorable way: waiters file into the dining room carrying mountains of creamy butter, which is served to every table accompanied by excellent bread with an incomparable texture.

    "### **Overview**\n",
    "The algorithm is designed to guide a robot that collects packages located on a grid, starting from the origin point (0,0). The robot can only move right ('R') or up ('U'). The goal is to collect all packages using the fewest moves while maintaining a lexicographically smallest path.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Input**\n",
    "- The number of test cases, `t`.\n",
    "- For each test case:\n",
    "  - The number of packages, `n`.\n",
    "  - The coordinates `(x_i, y_i)` of each package.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Output**\n",
    "- For each test case, print \"YES\" followed by the smallest path if all packages can be collected, or \"NO\" if it is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pseudocode**\n",
    "- The idea behind the followed *pseudocode* is that we want to divide each problem into smaller problems. Instead of thinking about \"How can we collect all the packages in the best way?\", we can firstly solve the problem \"How can i reach in the fastes way the next package?\" and iterate over the packages.\n",
    "- To develop this in the most efficient way, we have to sort the collection that will contain the coordinates of each package we are receiving in input, because we dont want to solve in the brute force way trying every path possible. To do that\n",
    "we compute the distance between the origin and each of the coordinates and we sort them on this distance. \n",
    "- Then we compute the **Manhattan Distance** (or **L1 distance**) that helps up to compute the number of single steps from point A to point B:\n",
    "$$ d = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| $$\n",
    "- We iterate over this number and in each iteration we decide to go up or right giving more value to the right because lexicographycally  $\"R\" < \"U\"$\n",
    "- Finally return the Path scaling this idea\n",

    "Here the pseudocode:\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: The starting point is (0, 0), which is trivially reachable from the origin.\n",

    "The algorithm checks if the next coordinate (`target_x`, `target_y`) can be reached using only \"U\" and \"R\". This is verified by checking that `target_x` is not less than `current_coordinate[0]` and `target_y` is not less than `current_coordinate[1]`.\n",
    "If this condition fails, the algorithm outputs \"NO\" and terminates, proving that reaching all points in the list is impossible with the allowed moves.\n",
    "If the condition holds, the algorithm updates current_coordinate and appends \"R\" and \"U\" moves accordingly, ensuring that only valid moves are added to result.\n",
    "\n",

    "This was the answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the time complexity of this code, let’s break down each section and determine the number of operations relative to $n$, where $n$ represents the number of packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Reading and Parsing Input**\n",
    "   - **File Reading**: The code reads $t$ test cases from a file. For each test case, it reads the number of packages and coordinates.\n",
    "   - **Parsing Coordinates**: Each coordinate pair is read and converted into an integer tuple, which is stored in a Numpy array. Parsing takes $O(n)$ time per test case since it reads $n$ coordinates, each in $O(1)$ time.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Time Complexity for Parsing Input**: $O(t \\times n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Calculating Distances**\n",
    "   - For each coordinate, the distance from the origin $0,0$ is calculated using the Euclidean formula $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.\n",
    "   - Calculating the distance for each of the $n$ points takes $O(n)$ time, as computing the distance for each point is $O(1)$.\n",

    "   - After sorting, the code creates a new array `sorted_coordinates` by rearranging the coordinates based on the sorted order, which is $O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Time Complexity for Sorting**: $O(t \\times n \\log n)$.\n",

    "   - For each coordinate, it checks if the target coordinate can be reached by only moving \"up\" (U) or \"right\" (R). This involves a constant-time check and, if infeasible, it returns immediately.\n",
    "   - If the target can be reached, the code calculates the distance along $x$ and $y$ axes.\n",
    "   - For each coordinate, it adds the steps to reach it. Moving each step and updating coordinates takes $O(1)$, and each package requires a bounded number of steps (no more than $x + y$ operations per package).\n",

It has broken in small parts the calculus of time complexity like we have done, but it wasnt accurate in my opinion on the study of the algorithm `compute_smallest_path` because it has made the assumption that the size of the path $p$ is $O(1)$. \n",

    "**Greedy Step**: At each step, the robot moves to the closest package (because we have previously sorted the list of packages). \n",
    "Let’s assume the greedy algorithm at some stage goes from the current position $(x_k,y_k)$ to some package $( 𝑥_𝑞 , 𝑦_𝑞)$, and then from $(x_q ​ ,y_q ​ )$ to $(x_p ​ ,y_p ​ )$ selecting the closest package.\n",
    "\n",
    " Now, let’s consider an another algorithm alternative (not *greedy*) swapping the two steps: first move from $(x_k ​ ,y_k ​ )$ to $(x_p ​ ,y_p ​ )$, and then move from $( 𝑥_𝑝 , 𝑦_𝑝 )$ to $(x_q ​ ,y_q ​)$. \n",
    "\n",
    " The total distance (equal to the **Manhattan Distance**) for the greedy choice is: $𝐷_{greedy} = |x_k − 𝑥_𝑝|+ |𝑦_𝑘 − 𝑦_𝑝| + |𝑥_𝑝 − 𝑥_𝑞| + |𝑦_𝑝 − 𝑦_𝑞|$\n",
    "\n",
    "The total distance for the alternative choice is: $D_{alternative} ​ = ∣x_k ​− x_q ∣ + ∣y_k− y_q∣ + ∣x_q − x_p∣ + |y_q​ − y_p|$\n",
    "\n",
    "The key observation here is that, by the triangle **inequality for Manhattan distance**, we have: \n",
    "$$ |x_k ​ −x_p ∣ + ∣y_k ​− y_p∣ + |𝑥_𝑝 − 𝑥_𝑞| + |𝑦_𝑝 − 𝑦_𝑞| \\le ∣ x_k − x_q∣ + ∣y_k​ − y_q∣ + ∣x_q − x_p∣ + ∣y_q​ − y_p∣$$\n",
