Andreina – Loreto - a MICHELIN Guide Restaurant	via Buffolareccia 14	Loreto	60025	ITA	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Meats and Grills	Sixty years after this restaurant was opened by his grandmother Andreina, Errico Recanati continues to add his own distinctive mark to the family business. Following the complete renovation of the farmhouse interior, the dining rooms are even more elegant and welcoming than before. Here, the excellent staff offer attentive and discreet service, while the cuisine, rooted in local traditions, focuses especially on game and grilled dishes. The only features that have survived in the dining room are the grill and the fireplace! Recanati’s distinctive style makes full use of fire, charcoal embers and the afore-mentioned grill and spit: he is a real expert in the latter, enabling delightful grilled flavours and aromas to make their way into most of his dishes, which he often personalises by adding fruit and vegetables from his own garden. All of this contributes to what the chef himself describes as his “neo-rural” style of cuisine, which is beautifully illuminated by new lamps arranged on the tables with the precision of a stage set.

Tre Olivi – Paestum - a MICHELIN Guide Restaurant	via Poseidonia 41	Paestum	84047	ITA	€€€€	Creative, Campanian	Oliver Glowig, German by birth but Italian by adoption, has returned to Campania where he’s now at the helm in the gourmet restaurant at the Savoy Beach Hotel. Here, his cuisine is showcased on two tasting menus (with dishes also available à la carte style) with many of his zero-mile ingredients sourced from the property’s own kitchen garden. He makes every effort to bring out the best of the Cilento’s abundant produce and typical Mediterranean recipes in his dishes which are contemporary in flavour and appearance. The restaurant’s only structural change is the new private room, which boasts its own kitchen, which can be used to host private events. The front of house also has new staff, whose skills ensure that guests are looked after with careful attention. When it comes to choosing wine, sommelier Roberto is on hand with his expert recommendations.

Osteria Arbustico – Paestum - a MICHELIN Guide Restaurant	via Francesco Gregorio 40	Paestum	84047	ITA	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Campanian	Housed within the Royal Paestum hotel, this elegant, contemporary restaurant boasts an attractively simple and minimalist ambience in which owner-chef Cristian Torsiello’s cuisine takes centre stage. This 40-year-old chef (originally from Valva, a district of Salerno where the Osteria was first opened) showcases creative ideas and techniques in his search for perfect combinations. His deceptively simple dishes always allow the flavour of his locally sourced ingredients to shine through – his iconic spaghetti with saffron is a perfect example. For this dish, he prepares dried Gragnono pasta in the same way as a risotto, using a broth made with one-third beef stock, one-third parmesan cheese and one-third onions. He then blends this with sour butter and Abruzzo saffron to create a dish that is truly delicious and seemingly simple, despite its complex preparation. The wine list continues to evolve, boasting some 600 labels and including a few rare regional wines.

Guidoristorante – Serralunga d'Alba - a MICHELIN Guide Restaurant	via Alba 15	Serralunga d'Alba	12050	ITA	€€€	Piedmontese, Contemporary	Lidia and Guido Alciati opened their restaurant in 1961 and Italian cuisine has not been the same since – their hard work signalled the beginning of real change which revolutionised cooking in Italy. They were among the first to understand the importance of regional ingredients, sourcing excellent produce which Lidia then showcased in her superb dishes, while Guido was responsible for the attentive service and excellent wine list. Their teachings live on in the sumptuous dining rooms in Villa Fontanafredda, where their children continue the culinary traditions established by their parents. Ugo’s sensitive skills in the kitchen and Piero’s experience front of house contribute to the success of this restaurant, where the best food and wine from the region in served in deceptively simple dishes that have few equals. One of the highlights is the plin (stuffed agnolotti pasta closed with a “pinch” by Lidia), which has drawn visitors here from all around the world and which is as delicious as ever – the pasta is stuffed with meat and vegetables and served with a velvety meat sauce. A modern fireplace adds a contemporary feel to the austere, old-fashioned elegance in one of the dining rooms.

The third, Mad100% Natura, is a blind tasting menu on which the chef demonstrates his love and passion for his ingredients with real creativity. Most of his vegetables are sourced from local biodynamic gardens and greenhouses. On our last visit, we particularly enjoyed the courgettes “alla beccafico”, spaghetti with tomato sauce in honour of Nonna Tita, and the vegetable pizza served as a dessert.

The cuisine is traditional yet with modern touches and based on Ligurian ingredients with a focus on fish (although meat also features).
