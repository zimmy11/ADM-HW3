Andreina – Loreto - a MICHELIN Guide Restaurant	via Buffolareccia 14	Loreto	60025	ITA	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Meats and Grills	Sixty years after this restaurant was opened by his grandmother Andreina, Errico Recanati continues to add his own distinctive mark to the family business. Following the complete renovation of the farmhouse interior, the dining rooms are even more elegant and welcoming than before. Here, the excellent staff offer attentive and discreet service, while the cuisine, rooted in local traditions, focuses especially on game and grilled dishes. The only features that have survived in the dining room are the grill and the fireplace!

The restaurant’s only structural change is the new private room, which boasts its own kitchen, which can be used to host private events. The front of house also has new staff, whose skills ensure that guests are looked after with careful attention.

Osteria Arbustico – Paestum - a MICHELIN Guide Restaurant	via Francesco Gregorio 40	Paestum	84047	ITA	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Campanian	Housed within the Royal Paestum hotel, this elegant, contemporary restaurant boasts an attractively simple and minimalist ambience in which owner-chef Cristian Torsiello’s cuisine takes centre stage. This 40-year-old chef (originally from Valva, a district of Salerno where the Osteria was first opened) showcases creative ideas and techniques in his search for perfect combinations. His deceptively simple dishes always allow the flavour of his locally sourced ingredients to shine through – his iconic spaghetti with saffron is a perfect example. For this dish, he prepares dried Gragnono pasta in the same way as a risotto, using a broth made with one-third beef stock, one-third parmesan cheese and one-third onions. He then blends this with sour butter and Abruzzo saffron to create a dish that is truly delicious and seemingly simple, despite its complex preparation. The wine list continues to evolve, boasting some 600 labels and including a few rare regional wines.

Guidoristorante – Serralunga d'Alba - a MICHELIN Guide Restaurant	via Alba 15	Serralunga d'Alba	12050	ITA	€€€	Piedmontese, Contemporary	Lidia and Guido Alciati opened their restaurant in 1961 and Italian cuisine has not been the same since – their hard work signalled the beginning of real change which revolutionised cooking in Italy. They were among the first to understand the importance of regional ingredients, sourcing excellent produce which Lidia then showcased in her superb dishes, while Guido was responsible for the attentive service and excellent wine list. Their teachings live on in the sumptuous dining rooms in Villa Fontanafredda, where their children continue the culinary traditions established by their parents. Ugo’s sensitive skills in the kitchen and Piero’s experience front of house contribute to the success of this restaurant, where the best food and wine from the region in served in deceptively simple dishes that have few equals. One of the highlights is the plin (stuffed agnolotti pasta closed with a “pinch” by Lidia), which has drawn visitors here from all around the world and which is as delicious as ever – the pasta is stuffed with meat and vegetables and served with a velvety meat sauce. A modern fireplace adds a contemporary feel to the austere, old-fashioned elegance in one of the dining rooms.

The cuisine is traditional yet with modern touches and based on Ligurian ingredients with a focus on fish (although meat also features).

Cucina Cereda – Ponte San Pietro - a MICHELIN Guide Restaurant	via Piazzini 33	Ponte San Pietro	24036	ITA	€€€	Modern Cuisine	A typical entrance leads into the courtyard of what was a monastery in the late 16C at this restaurant, where the dining room has a classic atmosphere.

There’s a simpler, business-style menu at lunchtime, while among the à la carte options we particularly enjoyed the snails served with morel mushrooms and a careful seasoning of parsley and coriander, and the paccheri pasta with fish soup in which the bouillabaisse-style sauce added a real Mediterranean flavour.

Venissa – Mazzorbo - a MICHELIN Guide Restaurant	fondamenta Santa Caterina 3	Mazzorbo	30142	ITA	€€€€	Country cooking, Contemporary	Far away from the tourist hordes, Venissa is situated in a small walled vineyard dating back to the Middle Ages – complete with 14C belltower – on the small island of Mazzorbo, a magical setting which is perfect for a short stroll before settling down to eat. In addition to the Dorona di Venezia vineyard, the restaurant also has a kitchen garden which provides most of its vegetables, including unusual varieties such as “castraure”, a type of local artichoke. Once out of the garden, you come to a small wooden bridge which links Mazzorbo to neighbouring Burano, where you can complete your visit to the lagoon by exploring the lacemakers’ shops and admiring the colourful local houses. The main focus here, however, is the cuisine – and excellent cuisine it is too! Chefs Chiara Pavan and Francesco Brutto describe their dishes as “ambientale” (environmental) because of the close connection between the lagoon and the Upper Adriatic: the menu features plenty of fish and vegetables and almost no meat. Guests choose their number of courses and the dishes come as a surprise, accompanied by organic wine pairings. At the Osteria Contemporanea next door the dishes are simpler but still full of flavour.

Zass – Positano - a MICHELIN Guide Restaurant	via Laurito 2	Positano	84017	ITA	€€€€	Mediterranean Cuisine, Contemporary	The legendary San Pietro is one of the jewels of the Amalfi Coast as well as one of the most famous hotels in the world. Zass, its Michelin-starred restaurant, is extremely popular with visitors (booking in advance is highly recommended) thanks to skilful Belgian chef Alois Vanlangenaeker, who has now been here for over 20 years. His cuisine showcases all the colours and flavours of the Mediterranean with harmony and elegance, focusing mainly on the traditions of Campania, especially in appetisers such as the small bites of lightly baked Pizza Margherita and in creative dishes elsewhere on the menu. Many of his ingredients are sourced from the hotel’s kitchen garden, which he uses to create dishes based on meat and, especially, fish, including his signature John Dory (flavoured with lemon and accompanied by mashed potatoes with bufala yoghurt, seasonal vegetables and his famous Champagne and truffle sauce), and other fish such as mullet, sea bass, scampi and squid. Excellent service, a pianist providing background music, and an idyllic terrace boasting stunning views all play their part in making this a truly memorable dining experience.

The menu features just one dessert, “spumone”, which is made for the restaurant by a nearby artisanal ice-cream parlour, and the restaurant doesn’t serve coffee, but people flock here for the excellent fish and the attractive prices, which are very reasonable given its coastal location.

The food is proudly inspired by local and family traditions, while at the same time constantly seeking to reinterpret these traditions and create new imaginative recipes. Examples include pears cooked in Aglianico wine served with raw shrimps and cow’s ricotta cheese, and raw fish and seafood options accompanied by a careful selection of seasonal vegetables. Two important features here are the focus on simple, traditional cooking techniques and the speed of preparation. The menu showcases the best of the area’s fresh fish, including pezzogna (a variety of sea bream), swordfish and tuna, supplemented when necessary by options from the nearby Cilento region. Other ingredients include tomatoes (which feature in almost half the dishes), Amalfi’s famous lemons (the classic lemon soufflé is highly recommended), basil and Agerola bread – you’ll want to order almost everything on the menu! The excellent wine list features reds, whites, sparkling, sweet, young and vintage wines, with legendary labels such as La Tâche listed alongside smaller, unknown, rare and organic wines.

Arnaldo - Clinica Gastronomica – Rubiera - a MICHELIN Guide Restaurant	piazza XXIV Maggio 3	Rubiera	42048	ITA	€€€	Emilian	This restaurant was first awarded a Michelin star in 1959, which makes it the longest-held star (with a break of only two years) in Italy. Housed in a 15C palazzo next to the Aquila d'Oro hotel, the dining room boasts an atmospheric and nostalgic feel. The cuisine has the same traditional focus and celebrates Emilian traditions in all their glory, especially on the trolleys used to display selections of antipasti (sliced ham always features, as does spinach and cheese pie), and desserts (including a delicious zabaione served with pear in red wine and a creamy Sambuca semifreddo. But the undisputed stars of the show are the meat dishes, especially the two trolleys of specialities that are the highlight of any visit to Arnaldo. These include roast and boiled meats, including dishes not often found in a restaurant of this quality, such as calf’s head, tongue and pig’s trotters, all cooked traditionally and served with the usual sauces and gravies. Every morning, the “sfogline” pasta-makers prepare excellent fresh pastas, which are served either in a broth or simply with sage and butter. Arnaldo is not a place for fans of modern cuisine but if you’re keen to try authentic Emilian dishes full of flavour, you’ll be in your element here!

Also new to the scene is talented and experienced chef Francesco Sodano, who offers three tasting menus: “Ricomincio da tre”, inspired by the Massimo Troisi film and his native region; “Contaminazioni”, a 6-8-course menu which combines the chef’s Asian experiences with regional and Italian ingredients; and “Vegetale”, which also features 6-8 courses and is based around produce sourced from the vegetable garden and other small-scale growers. The latter menu gives centre stage to the region’s abundance of vegetables, made all the more unique by bold combinations and innovative cooking methods.

Unforgettable – Turin - a MICHELIN Guide Restaurant	via Lorenzo Valerio 5/b	Turin	10122	ITA	€€€€	Innovative, Italian Contemporary	Although it seems incredible today, this restaurant in central Turin, situated just a stone’s throw from the Santuario della Consolata, stands on a street that once marked the boundary between the town and the surrounding countryside – to highlight the fact, after ringing the doorbell you make your way into what was once a farmhouse. Despite this traditional setting, chef Christian Mandura’s focus here is creative and occasionally extremely imaginative with dishes presented on a long tasting menu inspired by his varied experience. Having been greeted by the chefs in the kitchen, guests are then served at a counter where they sit side by side (there are ten seats in total). Vegetables take centre stage in Mandura’s dishes, with fish and meat usually served as an accompaniment, although if you prefer a menu based exclusively on one type of meat you can book the Paradigma dining room. There is also an original and personalised selection of drinks by the glass (not just wine) sourced by sommelier Jacopo from small-scale producers, including an excellent choice of vermouths.

She named her restaurant after the travelling salesman and the name has been kept in his memory. In a typical setting of stone walls and old rural objects from bygone days, Hélène is now front-of-house taking care of guests, while Nadia Mongiat has replaced her in the kitchen, where she continues with the restaurant’s tradition of creating simple Tuscan cuisine. The focus here is on preparing ingredients in traditional ways, such as pork liver (the thinnest part of the liver is used) cooked at a low temperature and then stored in lard with fennel for a few days before being re-heated sous-vide in a bain-marie. As a result, the liver (served lukewarm on a bed of Tuscan green beans) is soft and delicious.

Octavin – Arezzo - a MICHELIN Guide Restaurant	scalinata Camillo Berneri 2	Arezzo	52100	ITA	€€€€	Creative	Housed in two small dining rooms connected by an arch on the ground floor of an old palazzo, this restaurant is decorated with materials that give it a minimalist feel – a combination of stone, wood and iron in the tables, glass in the mirrors and bottles on display, and paper in the books arranged in small niches, just like the lounge of a private home. There are just 20 seats in this warm, intimate and unfussy restaurant, as well as a large counter separated by an arch at the entrance which precedes the recently restructured kitchen. Observation of his own region has shown owner-chef Luca Fracassi that the varied geography of his province is an inexhaustible source of inspiration. As a result, he has embarked upon an impassioned search for ingredients that best showcase the region, combining these in dishes that not only respect the flavours of his produce but also revive traditional local techniques and include the occasional oriental influence. His cuisine is modern yet eschews modern trends, paying careful attention to integrity of flavour and zero waste. In this way, the kitchen becomes a place in which wild ingredients and forgotten flavours are rediscovered and brought back to life. This focus on lost traditions combines ingredients such as snails and game (often neglected in urban restaurants) with a skilful and updated use of contemporary culinary techniques.

Amanõ – Cagliari - a MICHELIN Guide Restaurant	via Sidney Sonnino 68	Cagliari	09125	ITA	€€	Contemporary	The tilde accent over the “o” in the name of this restaurant is a subtle allusion to the sea that lies between Campania (the chef’s native region) and Sardinia (his adopted home).

There are two dining options here: the tasting menus showcase the chef’s creativity and precise techniques to the full in courses referred to as “provocazioni”, which focus on the use of just a few ingredients per dish. The second option is the à la carte, which features dishes that demonstrate the generous, classic flavours of the 1980s – for example, the main ingredient in these dishes is often served with an array of small bowls containing accompanying ingredients. The service is also more classic in feel, involving the addition of table linen and period-style glasses, plates and even chairs. Both options, of course, are created by the same chef with the same intention, which is to guide guests through an amusing culinary playground in which boredom and banality have been completely banished. It’s no coincidence that the background music is accompanied by a pleasant play of colourful effects.

One of the menus is inspired by the vegetable gardens and the seasons, another by the region, while the third takes guests on a culinary journey through Italy and further afield. What is obvious in every single, delicious bite is the chef’s passion for plants, with vegetables, flowers, wild and cultivated herbs harvested daily all featuring in memorable, beautifully presented dishes. The iconic appetisers featuring countless delicious ingredients are a feast for the eyes and the tastebuds alike and were particularly enjoyed by our inspectors. It hardly needs mentioning that this region is passionate about wine, so it’s not entirely surprising that the restaurant offers three different wine lists: Solopiemonte pays superb homage to the region, while Tuttoilresto (divided into two options, white and red) is a celebration of French wines. The efficient and enthusiastic serving staff succeed in taking good care of guests without being excessively formal, so that three hours (roughly the amount of time you need to allow for your meal) pass almost without noticing.

I Tenerumi – Isola Vulcano - a MICHELIN Guide Restaurant	via Vulcanello	Isola Vulcano	98055	ITA	€€€€	Vegetarian, Creative	We recommend arriving at this restaurant before the sun goes down so that you can enjoy the spectacular sunset over the Aeolian islands and the Faraglioni rocks. This is just a taster of the unique gastronomic experience that awaits, with dishes featuring on a long surprise tasting menu (there’s no choice) which is completely dedicated to vegetables and based on produce often grown on Vulcano. The roasted half onion served with its own fermented cream and flavoured with garlic and lemon is exceptional, as is the potato millefeuille served with a potato cream and abeurre blanc,all flavoured with chopped parsley stalks. 
Using techniques such as fermentation, marinating, oxidisation, smoking and many others, young chef Davide Guidara demonstrates real skill in adding flavour to vegetarian dishes that will leave a lasting memory and banish any nostalgia for meat. Dishes are accompanied by equally surprising drinks (including non-alcoholic options), with interesting cocktails created by a barman who often uses infusions made from the island’s herbs – we especially enjoyed those flavoured with sage, rosemary and peppermint. 
There’s a wine list dedicated exclusively to sparkling wines, plus a wider selection of almost 1000 labels (many from the region but also around the world) that is available on request. We particularly recommend the De Bartoli Terzavia , a fine sparkling wine made from Grillo grapes.
